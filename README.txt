We made a visualization of the the state population of the United States of America.
We used Firefox to run our visualization.

Our visualization can be sorted with the checkbox.
It switches between alphabetical and descending population.

You can also filter out states with a population below the amount on the slider bar(this is kinda buggy)
The filter does not filter until you interact with it.
